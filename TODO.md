# ClinicBridge TODO List (MVP + Stretch)

## Core MVP
- [ ] Real-time slot booking UI (by department/facility)
- [ ] "Book & Notify" action: send SMS/WhatsApp to patient with referral code & appointment details
- [ ] Referral status tracking for destination facilities
- [ ] Mobile clinic event creation UI (service type, date, geo-location, capacity)
- [ ] Geo-targeted SMS/WhatsApp broadcast for mobile clinics (stub/mock if not live)
- [ ] RSVP flow: allow patients to confirm via reply, decrement event capacity
- [ ] Appointment reminders & reschedule links (SMS/WhatsApp)
- [ ] Patient-facing confirmation page (with referral code input)
- [ ] Analytics: no-show rates, lead time to appointment, travel distance saved
- [ ] Charts for referral conversion, event attendance, slot utilization
- [ ] Dropdowns for selecting providers/departments in all forms (not free text)
- [ ] Advanced filtering/search for slots, patients, events (by date, department, provider, status)
- [ ] Explicit patient consent for notifications in all flows
- [ ] Store only minimal patient data (phone, referral code, consent)

## Stretch/Wow Features
- [ ] Smart waitlist: auto-notify next patient if a slot is canceled
- [ ] WhatsApp mini-assistant: quick commands for reschedule, directions
- [ ] QR/USSD check-in: patient check-in on arrival, live attendance update

## Other Enhancements

- [ ] Quick onboarding: facility/department creation, demo/test data
- [ ] Accessibility and mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Improved onboarding docs and contribution guidelines
